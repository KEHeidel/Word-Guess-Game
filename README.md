## Product Features

The objective of the game is to guess the name of the author by typing a letter on the keyboard. If the guessed letter is correct the letter will then appear in the correct space of the name. If the letter guessed is incorrect then the the number of guesses will decrease and the incorrect letter will show up in the letters guessed section. Once a name has been correctly guessed the score will increase by one and a new name will be generated. If the name is not correctly guessed by the time the number of guesses reaches zero a new name will be generated and the score will not be affected.
